Description:
Dolphin-As-Root-Plasma-5-and-Plasma-6
simple service menu

since i Create distributions based on kde called lancaster i had an issue on plasma 6 arch
i created this to fix the issues i was having with copying my distributions necessities to locked root directories
now you can open the dolphin as root with just one downloaded .desktop file
it Works with plasma 5 and plasma 6

Attention: please read up about root and system files before changing things, with this add-on !!
please note dolphin on plasma 6 is currently very buggy
and you may need to click this twice and enter your password twice
otherwise this works fine no issues

How to install:
- Dolphin -> Preferences -> Services -> Download New Services...
...or
For kde5
- move the downloaded open-dolphin-as-root.desktop file to
~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus (create the folder if it's missing)
Also use right click on the file > Properties > Permissions >
And mark the checkbox next to the text "Is executable".
For kde6
- move the downloaded/open-dolphin-as-root.desktop file to
~/.local/share/kio/servicemenus/ (create the folder if it's missing)
Also use right click on the file > Properties > Permissions >
And mark the checkbox next to the text "Is executable".
